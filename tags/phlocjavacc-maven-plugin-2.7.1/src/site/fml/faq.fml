      <question>How can I use custom sources for some of the generated parser files?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          If you have custom source files like a hand-crafted <code>Token.java</code> and want to use these files
          instead of the ones generated by JavaCC/JJTree/JTB, simply store your custom sources in the ordinary
          directory for Java sources, i.e. usually <code>src/main/java</code>. This will prevent the plugin from
          generating these files.
        </p>
        <p>
          For plugin versions prior to 2.5, you will need to put any custom source files directly next to the grammar
          file instead. The plugin will then copy your sources to the output directory of the generated parser file
          such that they eventually make it onto your class path. This approach is still supported by newer plugin
          versions but not recommended.
